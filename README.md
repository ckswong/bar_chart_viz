# Gun Violence Data

This is a bar chart visualization of the rate of gun violence in the US on a yearly basis. 

Originally intended as a chart of mass shootings. However, there is some debate as to what defines a mass shooting (particularly the minimum casuality threshold), which is why there is a option for the user to choose their own threshold. 

Finally, the user is allowed to choose between different years to compare the rates of gun violence.
